## TO DO


This list is based on feedback for react annotation graph V0.1 by T2D AMP consortium members

 - [ ] Tabular view of results, sortable and searchable
 - [x] Aggregate same annotation names on the display for a given tissue (aka reduce reduncy) 
 - [x] Display only prominent annotations by default at the same time giving user the ability to view all results if interested
 - [ ] Add additional annotation datasets for sparse annotation type (particularly for target gene prediction) 
 - [ ] Show cell type label on graph by default
 - [ ] Ability to save/download the image or table
 - [ ] Make filters that are currently being applied more explicit
 - [ ] Add genome tab to view annotations in integrated genome browser
 - [ ] Add radial plot tab to show quantitative values where applicable
