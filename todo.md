## TO DO


This list is based on feedback for react annotation graph V0.1 by T2D AMP consortium members

- [ ] Tabular view of results 
- [ ] Aggregate same annotation names on the display for a given tissue (aka reduce reduncy) 
- [ ] Display only prominent annotations by default at the same time giving user the ability to view all results
- [ ] Add annotation datasets for sparse annotation type (interest in target gene prediction) 
- [ ] Show cell types on graph by default
- [ ] Ability to save/download the image
