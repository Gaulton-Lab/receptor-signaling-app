## TO DO


This list is based on feedback for react annotation graph V0.1 by T2D AMP consortium members

 - [ ] Tabular view of results 
 - [x] Aggregate same annotation names on the display for a given tissue (aka reduce reduncy) 
 - [x] Display only prominent annotations by default at the same time giving user the ability to view all results
 - [ ] Add annotation datasets for sparse annotation type (interest in target gene prediction) 
 - [ ] Show cell type label on graph by default
 - [ ] Ability to save/download the image
